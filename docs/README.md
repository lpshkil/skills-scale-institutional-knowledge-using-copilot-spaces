# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme’s project management framework ensures repeatable, customer-focused delivery across cross-functional teams. These living documents centralize team knowledge, accelerate onboarding, and equip members to collaborate and improve processes together.

### Purpose

- Centralize process guidance so teams can onboard faster and execute more consistently.
- Document decision rationale and process improvements so everyone stays informed.
- Connect this repository as a structured knowledge source for workflows and standards.

### Principles

- Customer-first: prioritize outcomes and usability in every phase.
- Iterative delivery: ship frequent, testable increments for faster learning.
- Clear ownership: named responsibles for project execution and outcomes (see Roles).
- Data-driven decisions: measure impact, analyze experiments, and evolve processes.
- Psychological safety: encourage transparent conversation about risks, trade-offs, and improvements.

### Project Lifecycle

1. Initiation — Validate the problem, align stakeholders, outline success metrics.
2. Planning — Define scope, resources, milestones, risks, and actionable tasks.
3. Execution — Build, test, track progress, and escalate blockers using team-defined rhythms.
4. Release & Deployment — Standardize delivery to production, verify results, communicate updates.
5. Retrospective & Continuous Improvement — Capture learnings, prioritize improvements, and reinforce an iterative culture.

### Core Roles

- Project Manager: Coordinates schedules, risks, communications, and documentation.
- Product Manager: Defines outcomes, manages backlog, and drives prioritization.
- Developers: Implement, test, and maintain features.
- QA/Testing: Validate requirements and acceptance criteria.
- Stakeholders: Provide input, feedback, and approvals.
